      " <<SYS>> You're an assistant. <</SYS>> Based on the provided context, it appears that the company is facing several risks. Firstly, there is a risk of liability under laws, regulations, and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs and significant legal and financial exposure. Additionally, the company relies on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material impact. Furthermore, the company's financial performance is also subject to various risks, including the potential for stock-based compensation and operating lease right-of-use liabilities to impact its financial statements. It's also important to note that the company has a valuation allowance of $892 million, which could indicate potential impairment of its assets. Overall, it seems that the company is facing a range of risks that could impact its financial performance and reputation.
