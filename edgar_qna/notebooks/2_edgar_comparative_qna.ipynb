      "For Uber, the risk of being unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of drivers is a significant concern, as it could lead to a decrease in the appeal of their platform to users. To mitigate this risk, Uber has implemented various strategies, such as offering incentives to drivers, improving the driver experience, and investing in technology to improve the efficiency and safety of the platform.\n",

To mitigate this risk, Lyft has implemented strategies such as offering competitive compensation and benefits to drivers, investing in driver support and development programs, and focusing on creating a positive driver experience.\n",
