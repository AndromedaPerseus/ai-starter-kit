p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,Snapchat failed to act on rampantreports of child grooming sextortion and other dangers to minors on its platform according to a newly unredacted complaint against the company filed by New Mexicos attorney general
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,Attorney General Ral Torrez filed the original complaint on Sept 4 but internal messages and other details were heavily redacted Tuesdays filing unveils internal messages among Snap Inc employees and executives that provide further confirmation that Snapchats harmful design features create an environment that fosters sextortion sexual abuse and unwanted contact from adults to minors Torrez said in a news release
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,For instance former trust and safety employees complained there was pushback from management when they tried to add safety mechanisms according to the lawsuit Employees also noted that user reports on grooming and sextortion persuading a person to send explicit photos online and then threatening to make the images public unless the victim pays money or engages in sexual favors were falling through the cracks At one point an account remained active despite 75 reports against it over mentions of nudes minors and extortion
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,Snap said in a statement that its platform was designed with builtin safety guardrails and that the company made deliberate design choices to make it difficult for strangers to discover minors on our service
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,We continue to evolve our safety mechanisms and policies from leveraging advanced technology to detect and block certain activity to prohibiting friending from suspicious accounts to working alongside law enforcement and government agencies among so much more the company said
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,According to the lawsuit Snap was well aware but failed to warn parents young users and the public that sextortion was a rampant massive and incredibly concerning issue on Snapchat
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,A November 2022 internal email from a trust and safety employee says Snapchat was getting around 10000 user reports of sextortion each month
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,If this is correct we have an incredibly concerning issue on our hands in my humble opinion the email continues
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,Another employee replied that its worth noting that the number likely represents a small fraction of this abuse since users may be embarrassed and because sextortion is not easy to categorize when trying to report it on the site
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-mexicos-lawsuit-against-snap-214908339.html,Torrez filed the lawsuit against Santa Monica Californiabased Snap Inc in state court in Santa Fe In addition to sexual abuse the lawsuit claims the company also openly promotes child trafficking and thesale of illicit drugsand guns

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reverse-mortgage-lender-longbridge-financial-173708063.html,That independence is a smoke screen according to Longbridge In the case of Review Counsel the entity is owned by Mutual of Omaha for the purposes of mortgage lead generation which Longbridge allegedly corroborates based on a filing with Californias Secretary of State RMD verified through online records with the secretarys office that Review Counsels mailing address is one shared with Mutual of Omaha but it could not independently confirm the lead generation claim

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reverse-mortgage-lender-longbridge-financial-173708063.html,Longbridge goes on to allege that the RFS website is simply a funneling tool for consumers to Mutual of Omahas products backstopping the false narrative on the Review Counsel and Advisory Institute websites that RFS is an alternative to Mutual of Omaha the complaint alleges

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,On thediagnostic side AI is being used to streamline medical imaging cutting down time for tasks like identifying patterns in medical data which improves both speed and accuracy in patient care The goal is not to rid the world of human radiologists and technicians but empower them with 21stcentury tools that lighten their load and accelerate patient diagnoses and recoveries
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,AI proponents say its not just about cutting costs its about revolutionizing patient care By using vast datasets of clinical information the promise of AI is to somedayhelp predict patient outcomes more effectively modeling care before it happens to anticipate complications and select treatments
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,The other great hope for medical AI bulls is the immense promise for drug discovery
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,According toMorgan Stanleys healthcare forecast the companys head of US biopharma research Terence Flynn estimates that every 25 improvement in preclinical development success rates could lead to an additional 30plus new drug approvals over 10 years which would represent around 70 billion
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,Before the long tail of AI promises in healthcare are realized Yoder emphasizes that there are strong areas of growth in healthcare right now like the strong performance ofGLP1 drugs which have put a few pharma stocks in the same league as their AI counterparts in the Magnificent Seven Past diabetes treatment and obesity theres still lots of potential for broad preventative care applications particularly with type 2 diabetes Yoder noted
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,The data from the trials looks promising The rate of stopping you from turning into a type 2 diabetic is north of 98 she said
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,But despite AIs potential significant roadblocks remain and trust is a big one
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,Over 55 of healthcare professionals believe AI isnt ready for primetimemedical use according to a GE Healthcare survey of 7500 clinicians around the world And only 26 of US responsdents think AI can be trusted lagging the 42 of those who responded globally With actual lifeordeath stakes this represents a major hurdle along with the web of legacy technology that would need to be integrated Much of the infrastructure like electronic medical records is outdated and not built for seamless AI integration
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,Another area facing delays is AIdriven surgery While AIpowered robots already assist inremote telesurgeries humans are still driving the bus and the concept of fully autonomous surgical procedures is still far from reality
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,Despite the industrys inertia and barriers to change Yoder remains optimistic about healthcares growth potential as a longterm investment And should something happen to the economy and the Feds soft landing the sector has a key advantage Its a defensive largecap space with low volatility As Yoder noted not only is healthcare spending ticking up as a percentage of the GDP but when a recession hits healthcare keeps chugging along

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-scramble-divert-flights-iran-220309852.html,Eurocontrol a panEuropean air traffic control agency earlier sent a warning to pilots about the escalating conflict
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-scramble-divert-flights-iran-220309852.html,A major missile attack has been launched against Israel in the last few minutes At present the entire country is under a missile warning it said in an urgent navigation bulletin

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,Oil prices CLFBZFjumped about 25afterIran blitzed Israel with several hundred ballistic missileson Oct 1 Israel seems certain to retaliate and Iran could reretaliate which basically means the broader Middle East war many have been fearing has arrived
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,That pop in oil prices however is tiny and it reflects the markets belief that Mideast oil will keep flowing even as bombs and missiles thicken the skies The regions warring parties may want to kill each other but its in virtually everybodys interest to prevent oil supply disruptions that could send prices soaring
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,Thats especially true in the United States where some have speculated that a wider Mideast war could be a nasty October surprise that could cause oil shortages send oil and gasoline prices soaring and damage Vice President Kamala Harriss election odds Theres certainly a chance of that but the more likely outcome is that whatever ultimately happens between Israel Iran and nations or factions aligning with either side will not turn out to be an energy war
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,The unprecedented Iranian attack on Israel was a response to Israels own whittling down of the Hezbollah and Hamas terrorist groups that Iran trains funds and uses to do much of its dirty work throughout the Middle East The July 31 assassination of a top Hamas official in Tehran was likely an Israeli job and on Sept 27 Israel killed Hezbollahs leader in Beirut Lebanon
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,The whole fracas stems from the brutal Hamas attack on Israel last Oct 7 in which terrorists killed nearly 2000 Israelis Israel responded by invading the Gaza Strip Hamass home base and its that ongoing war that seeded the mushrooming battle thats playing out now Hostilities in the region are complex and go back decades but Irans theocratic government with its medieval policy of seeking the extermination of Israel is a principal instigator
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,So Israel and tacitly its allies may view the widening of the war as an opportunity to deal the nettlesome Iran a decisive blow that damages or destroys its nuclear weapons program targets elements of its leadership or goes after major military infrastructure Israel could also attack Iranian oil facilities which would imperil the countrys most important source of hard currency and kneecap its economy
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,But it probably wont Here are three reasons why
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,First Israels most important ally the United States is assuredly pressuring Israels leadership to leave Irans oil facilities alone Israel obviously doesnt always listen to its No 1 patron but it will on this In a direct confrontation with Iran Israel will need US assistance more than ever including intelligence defensive military assistance war materiel and diplomatic solidarity Israel at a minimum can keep Iranian oil facilities off the target list in exchange

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,Iran supplies about 15 of the worlds oil which may not sound like a lot But oil prices can move sharply on marginal changes in supply and if Irans oil disappeared from the market prices would jump way more than that puny 25 bump which is based on fears of disruption not actual disruption
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,If Iran could no longer export oil it would have a much more powerful incentive to strike at other producers by trying to close the Strait of Hormuz which its navy could probably do for a period of time About 21 of the worlds oil flows through the strait and anything that threatened that supply would send oil prices well above 100 per barrel and maybe above 150 US gasoline prices would hit 5 per gallon and maybe 6 or 7 It should go without saying that the Biden administration would do just about anything to prevent that from happening in the home stretch of a tight presidential election in which Harris is basically running on the incumbent partys record
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,Another powerful factor in the Middle East is China which buys most of Irans oil and is forging partnerships with many oil producers in the region China is a net importer of oil that wants to keep prices low It buys Iranian and Russian oil below market prices because it doesnt comply with Western sanctions meant to punish both countries for hostile actions And it wants to keep that cheap oil coming
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,China may not yet be as powerful a presence in the Middle East as the United States is but it has influence over Iran because it provides the bulk of its badly needed oil revenue China cant tell Israel what to attack or spare but it can make clear to Iran that any action threatening any nations oil supplies is simply unacceptable
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,Other oil producers in the region such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates dont really want an oil shock either Sure they benefit when prices rise and their revenues go up But the instability carries risk and could threaten other priorities Saudi Arabia for instance still wants tonormalize trade and economic relations with Israel which is also a priority of the Biden administration
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,That might be unlikely amid the current conflagration but waiting for a more opportune time would still be a lot better than trying to ride out an oil war Just five years agoIran attacked Saudi oil facilities one of the biggest shortterm supply disruptions in history The two countriespatched up their differences a year ago with Chinese mediation suggesting neither sees energy wars as productive
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-a-wider-middle-east-war-doesnt-have-to-mean-higher-oil-and-gas-prices-214649014.html,Predictions about the Middle East often border on folly given the regions volatile and violent history Yet the oil has flowed through numerous wars and countless skirmishes and thats the likely outcome this time as well If only peace were as readily attainable as oil

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Exactly five weeks from today on Nov 5 voters from across the country will weigh in and decide which presidential nominee former President Donald Trump or current Vice President Kamala Harris will lead our nation forward over the next four years
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,What happens on Capitol Hill doesnt always have relevance to Wall Street But elections ultimately determine which president and political parties will shape fiscal policy over the next at minimum two yearsUnderstanding the economic policy proposalsof the two presidential candidatesdoeshave bearing for the investing community and corporate America
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,For former President Donald Trump his message has remained similar to what he echoed during his 2020 campaign Hes proposed a handful of new personal tax breaks wants to further reduce the corporate tax rate to spur economic growth is a big promoter of domestic energy production and plans to get tougher with China
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,While there are some pretty clear winners of this potential scenario there are also timetested andor highflying stocks that can end up as losers
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,What follows are three marketleading stocks that can plunge if Donald Trump wins in November
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,The first widely held stock that may be contending with some difficult headwinds if Trump wins in five weeks is Wall Streets leadingartificial intelligence AIcompanyNvidiaNASDAQ NVDA
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,As most investors are probably aware Nvidias stock has enjoyed a historic ascent with the company benefiting from a textbook expansion of its operations In short order Nvidias AIgraphics processing units GPUs became the undisputed preferred choice for businesses running generative AI solutions and buildingtraining large language models
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Though the prospect of lowering the corporate tax rate could at least temporarily juice Nvidias gross margin and allow it to hang onto more of its income another key aspect of Trumps economic plan has the potential to limit Nvidias upside
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Specifically Trump plans to take a hardline stance with China the worlds No 2 economy by gross domestic product Hes proposed a 60 tariff on goods imported into the US from China Although Nvidia isnt importing products from China the global No 2 economy has consistently been a key generator of sales for Nvidia The potential for Trump to spark a trade war may eliminate Chinas desire altogether to purchase chips from Californiabased Nvidia
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,To add to the above regulators under the Biden administration have on two occasions limited Nvidias ability to export its highpowered AIGPUs to China over the last two years Id deem it unlikely that Trump or his administration would ease or lift these restrictions which are capping Nvidias revenue potential in a key market
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Id be remiss if I didnt also mention that every nextbigthing technology trend and innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble Investors consistently overestimate the adoption and utility of gamechanging innovations and AI seems unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule If the AI bubble were to burst under a Trump presidency arguably no company would feel the sting more than Nvidia
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,A second market leader that may be set to plummet if Donald Trump wins a second term is electricvehicle EV manufacturerTeslaNASDAQ TSLA
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Tesla has used its firstmover advantages to build itself from the ground up to producing in the neighborhood of 2 million EVs annually on a runrate basis It became the first EV company to generate a recurring profit and is attempting to diversify its operations by expanding into energy storage
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Although former President Trump has hinted at giving Tesla CEO Elon Musk a position in his administration if reelected in November hes also been critical of EV tax credits and tax incentives While Trump hasnt concretely said hed do away with the 7500 EV tax credit for new purchases his statements suggest this is a real possibility
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Tax credits play an important role in providing a potential price advantage for EVs when compared to internal combustionengine vehicles If this credit is removed arguably the mostenticing competitive edge for EVs goes away especially with EV charging infrastructure still somewhat limited
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,To add to the above Teslas reliance on unsustainable sources of income specifically interest income earned on its cash and automotive regulatory tax credits have rapidly increased as a percentage of pretax income In the Juneended quarter approximately 66 of Teslas pretax income came from these two sources with 890 million of its 189 billion pretax profit from regulatory credits
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Its also unclear how Trumps tariff policy will affect domestic and international sales of EVs for Americanbased companies Tesla has been aggressively reducing the sales price of its EVs Models 3 S X and Y since the start of 2023 to counter growing competition and rising inventory levels Unfortunately these price cuts havent stopped inventory levels from rising on a yearoveryear basis and theyve clobbered the companys operating margin
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Even if Musk were to land a role in the Trump administration Tesla is a stock that would likely struggle with the former president back in the Oval Office
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,The third magnificent stock that may be poised to plunge if Donald Trump wins in November is Wall Streets largest company by market capAppleNASDAQ AAPL
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Although Apples stock has soared in 2024 on the heels of its AI ambitions and excitement surrounding the eventual incorporation of AI tools into its topselling iPhone its the companys Services segment thats been the real highlight for years CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a transformation that will see Apple become a platforms company A subscriptiondriven model should lift its operating margin smooth out the sales fluctuations that occur during iPhone upgrade cycles and further enhance the companys impressive customer loyalty
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Similar to Nvidia it might also benefit from a further reduction of the corporate tax rate Apple has repurchased a marketleading 7006 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013 and reduced its outstanding share count by 422 in the process A lower corporate tax rate may encourage even more buybacks
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,On the other hand Apple imports some of its products from China is reliant on a meaningful portion of its iPhone sales from China and the overwhelming majority of its iPhones along with Macs and iPads are assembled in China Between tariffs and the potential antiAmerican sentiment caused by a trade war with China Apple could see its already stalling growth engine come to a complete halt
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,Though buybacks have played a key role in lifting Apples earnings per share over the last 11 years what ails Apples growth engine cant be fixed with the markets leading share repurchase program Even a reduction in corporate tax rates wont be enough offset the persistent sales weakness Apple has been contending with across all of its physical product lines
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-3-market-leading-stocks-090600306.html,While tech stocks and all three major stock indexes thrived under Trumps first term in office its my prediction that Apple will flounder if Trump wins in November

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,Theres a prominent issue in the DeFi space that I continue to find alarming and yet despite the solution being obvious in many cases it continues to be ignored Im talking about licensing and compliance and how crypto platforms DeFi protocols and all sorts of blockchain apps are failing to pursue compliance from day one Instead theyre opting to become compliant at some point in the future once theyve scaled This is a mistake
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,The Goldman Sachs Merrill Lynchs and BlackRocks of the future will be built on the blockchain Im almost certain of that The administrative and economic benefits of decentralization allow for improved resource allocation greater autonomy and transparency and overall better accountability For those reasons and countless others the worlds biggest companies will either be decentralized or harnessing the technology in new ways Unfortunately despite all the advantages decentralization simply doesnt fully compensate for regulation in fact many people and projects misuse the tech to avoid compliance and evade detection
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,If Im right the companies that will eventually rise to the top of the new financial order will be those that were strictly compliant carefully regulated and accurately licensed from the getgo They simply have to tick those boxes to have any chance at scaling to a huge size without coming under intense scrutiny and being shut down or sanctioned Im not saying that blockchain companies who didnt take that approach cannot become market leaders but they do make it much harder for themselves
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,We only have to look at Binance to see that my point is valid Binance and many others like them launched crypto exchanges at a time when regulation and compliance was thin and underdeveloped Yet rather than preempting what kind of rules might be implemented later they were nonchalant about it The most notable incident was Binances 43bn fine and Changpeng Zhao going to jail However that did not occur in isolation Binance was fined 225m in India for noncompliance in June 438m in Canada in May for money laundering and last month it received a 17m penalty in Brazil for violating derivatives trading laws Let me also remind you that Nigeria is holding a Binance official for ransom over money laundering claims against the exchange
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,Binances recent runins with the law and regulatory bodies should worry other exchanges whose stories are eerily similar Regulations are going top down starting with the big lowhanging fruit All of the big exchanges are currently facing issues in one way or another Coinbase is embroiled in a battle with the SEC over clarity on crypto regulations Bybit has just been forced to leave France due to regulatory pressure and OKX recently exited India and Nigeria due to local compliance issues
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,Crypto exchanges affect millions of people and billions of dollars but its not only exchanges that regulators want to make more compliant Ripple has the ambition to be one of the biggest financial services institutions in the world and certainly in the blockchain space with its nearzero fees and almostinstant transactions Unfortunately their much publicized legal challenges with the SEC have genuinely impeded the companys progress and reputation even if theyve won some of the battles Notably Ripple has focused on compliance and regulation since launching in 2012 and thats why theyve been able to battle regulators so diligently and robustly defend their legal rights and positions
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,Now I suspect that Ripple and their XRP token were the big fish that the SEC regulators wanted to hook in but it hasnt quite gone their way The SEC did however quite openly list some of the other major blockchains and tokens that they deem to be in violation of securities laws When filing charges against Binance last year they also named SOL ADA MATIC FIL ATOM SAND MANA ALGO AXS and COTI as crypto asset securities
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,Heres the issue with regulators topdown approach it means that whenever a DeFi platform becomes large enough it will face scrutiny This could incentivize platforms to stay small and avoid scaling which suppresses innovation On the other hand any platform that knowingly and willingly facilitates rogue and unlawful transactions is completely complicit in the crime The privacy benefits of the blockchain are not there to protect criminals
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compliance-starting-point-crypto-platforms-161931263.html,To add to the situation Im concerned that without compliance it is difficult to win the trust of institutional investors which means that some genuinely revolutionary and highutility technologies might never make it to the mainstream Theres an ideological battle going on between the DeFi maximalists who want to exist in anonymity providing underground financial services and the real world where compliance regulation and licensing is necessary to protect all parties My advice is that any unregulated platform protocol or dApp that has big ambitions should seek immediate legal support to future proof their entity

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,On PBS Jamie Dimon described the Buffett Rule as a good idea for clamping down on US debt
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,It says richer households shouldnt pay taxes on a smaller share of income than middleclass ones
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,He argued that if the US followed this it could continue spending while still reducing debt
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has put forth a solution to unrestrained US debt Tax the rich at the same rate as middleclass people or at a higher rate
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,The bank executive told PBS News Hour in August that the country could clamp down on runaway borrowing without eliminating spending Dimon said he expects that reducing the debt while still investing in the right initiatives is doable
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,I would spend the money that helps make it a better country so some of this is infrastructure earnedincome tax credits military he said I would have a competitive national tax system and then I would maximize growth
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,Dimon added And then youll have a little bit of a deficit and you would maybe just raise taxes a little bit like the Warren Buffett type of rule I would do that
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,Thisruleposits that no household making above 1 million a year should pay taxes on a lower share of their income than middleclass earners It earned its name from the billionaire investor Warren Buffett who famously criticized the fact that his secretary paid a higher tax rate than he did

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,Anxiety has grown as the governments debt pile hasballoonedto a record 35 trillion The Congressional Budget Office has projected that it could make up6 of US GDP by the end of this year which would far outpace the 50year average of 37
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,If debt remains unchecked amid high interest rates the government will face higher borrowing costs Some say that this mightcompound debt levelsand that theUS could eventually spiral into a default
p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,Otherwise higher borrowing costs mean Washington will have less to spend on social initiatives A recent report from thePeter G Peterson Foundationpointed out that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2054 interest payments on the debt will triple Washingtons historical spending on research and development infrastructure and education

p,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-buffett-rule-014552492.html,However speaking with PBS Dimon argued that the US should continue to spend money that helps maintain its economic strength and creates a more equitable income environment
